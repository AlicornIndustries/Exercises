uniteUnique([1, 3, 2], [5, 2, 1, 4], [2, 1]);

/*
Naive:
Ex. [1, 3, 2], [5, 2, 1, 4], [2, 1]
* flatten -> [1,3,2,5,2,1,4,2,1]
* remove duplicates -> [1,3,2,5,4]
** Probably a builtin for this, but to do it manually: use hash table

Would probably be more efficient if we did remove dups at the same time as flattening
