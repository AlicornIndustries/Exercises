/*
Naive approach: regex.

Future:
* Handling for other country codes.

Problematic test cases that should  fail are mismatched/misplaced parens.
(6054756961)
555)-555-5555 : unclosed parens
(555-555-5555

Only valid way to have parens is if they're wrapped around the first 3-digit block.
OR || is one way to do it. Perhaps not the cleanest.
Basically: does it match the no-parens formats (with spaces, dashes, no spaces) or a paren format.

Regex should short-circuit out when it hits the start of the first three-digit block if it's not the right one
of those two formats, so we're ideally only redoing the country code part.
Tradeoff a little bit of efficiency for readability.
